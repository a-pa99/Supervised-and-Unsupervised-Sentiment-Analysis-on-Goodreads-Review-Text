### Motivation

Goodreads is an online catalog where users can search, review, and register books. This website also allows for quote and annotation searches. With so much text information offered on the website, our team was motivated  to perform a sentiment analysis on Goodread reviews. 

To do this, we used datasets from the goodreads website UCSD Book Graph website (See requested citations below). Our goal for this project was to see which machine learning method, supervised or unsupervised, was  best for predicting sentiment from the review text.
